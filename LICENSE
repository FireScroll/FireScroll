To keep the License simple:

Section 1: You may (not intended to be comprehensive):
a. Use this for personal projects
b. Use this within your company to power other products that are not directly exposing FireScroll as the functionality (e.g. offering a distributed KV store backed by FireScroll)
c. Use this in commercial and non commercial settings
d. Fork, clone, modify, and contribute!

Section 2: You may NOT (not comprehensive):
a. Sell hosted FireScroll
b. Sell a thin layer over FireScroll (e.g. offering a distributed KV store backed by FireScroll)
c. Clone FireScroll without keeping open source and openly referencing FireScroll as the parent

Omission from section 2 is not express or implicit permission. Use common sense. If you are unsure, please reach out! Section 1 is also not comprehensive, there are likely more instances where FireScroll would be well used.

Use common sense to determine if your use case is considered permitted and/or ethical!

The maintainers of FireScroll reserve all rights to modify the License.
