To keep the license simple:

Section 1: You may (not intended to be comprehensive):
- Use this for personal projects
- Use this within your company to power other products that are not directly exposing Firescroll as the functionality (e.g. offering a distributed KV store backed by Firescroll)
- Use this in commercial and non commercial settings
- Fork, clone, modify, and contribute!

Section 2: You may NOT (not comprehensive):
- Sell hosted Firescroll
- Sell a thin layer over Firescroll (e.g. offering a distributed KV store backed by Firescroll)
- Clone Firescroll without keeping open source and openly referencing Firescroll as the parent

Omission from section 2 is not express or implicit permission. Use common sense. If you are unsure, please reach out! Section 1 is also not comprehensive, there are likely more instances where Firescroll would be well used.

Use common sense to determine if your use case is considered permitted and/or ethical!
